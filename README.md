# jev-conventional-commits

A fast git hook that classifies your staged diff and prefixes your commit message with
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) syntax, using
[TypeSafe's Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai/api) model.

```console
$ git commit -m "handle empty config files"
$ git log -1 --format=%s
fix(config): handle empty config files
```

## How it works

Jev doesn't write text. It picks an answer from a set you define up front and says how
confident it is. That suits this tool:

- **You** write the description.
- **Jev** picks the `type` (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, …) and whether the change is breaking (`!`).
- **Local rules** pick the `scope` from the paths you changed, and skip the model call
  when the answer is obvious (for example, a docs-only diff).

If the model isn't confident enough, or can't be reached, your message is left unchanged.

## Install

macOS and Linux:

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/jamiesanson/jev-conventional-commits/releases/latest/download/jev-cc-installer.sh | sh
```

Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://github.com/jamiesanson/jev-conventional-commits/releases/latest/download/jev-cc-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

Prebuilt archives for each platform are also on the
[releases page](https://github.com/jamiesanson/jev-conventional-commits/releases). To build from
source, run `cargo install --path .`.

Then:

```sh
jev-cc login     # once: paste your TypeSafe API key
jev-cc install   # in each repository
```

With `git commit -m`, the prefix goes in front of your message. With the editor, the first
line is pre-filled (e.g. `fix(config): `) for you to finish.

`install` won't overwrite existing `prepare-commit-msg` or `commit-msg` hooks. Add
`jev-cc <hook> "$@"` to them yourself.

Try it without committing:

```console
$ git add -p
$ jev-cc classify "handle empty config files"
fix(config): handle empty config files
  source: Jev, confidence: 87%, took 180ms
```

### Prefixing commits later

Commits made offline are left unprefixed. Once you're back online, prefix them in one go:

```console
$ jev-cc reword --dry-run   # show what would change
$ jev-cc reword
```

This covers the current branch's commits since it left `main` (or `master`), pushed or
not; on `main` itself, that's your unpushed commits. It runs a `git rebase`, so hashes
change and signed commits are signed again. If you reword commits you've already pushed,
push with `git push --force-with-lease`. For a branch stacked on another, pass
`--since <parent-branch>`.

## Configuration

Settings are read from these places, each overriding the one before:

1. `~/.config/jev-cc/config.toml`, for your own defaults
2. `.jev-cc.toml` at the repository root, for settings shared with your team
3. environment variables

```toml
# .jev-cc.toml
min_confidence = 0.75
exclude = ["secrets/**", "**/*.pem"]
types = ["feat", "fix", "docs", "refactor", "test", "chore"]

[scopes]
"packages/web" = "web"
"packages/web/admin" = "admin"
"packages/api" = "api"
```

| Setting | Environment variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|---|
| `timeout_ms` | `JEV_CC_TIMEOUT_MS` | `1000` | Request timeout |
| `deadline_ms` | `JEV_CC_DEADLINE_MS` | `2000` | Time limit for the whole hook |
| `min_confidence` | `JEV_CC_MIN_CONFIDENCE` | `0.6` | Minimum confidence to apply a type |
| `breaking_threshold` | `JEV_CC_BREAKING_THRESHOLD` | `0.85` | Probability needed to add `!` |
| `disable` | `JEV_CC_DISABLE` | `false` | |
| `exclude` | | `[]` | Paths never sent to Jev |
| `types` | | all built-in types | Types jev-cc may choose from |
| `scopes` | | | Path prefixes mapped to scopes |
| `base_url` | `JEV_CC_BASE_URL` | `https://api.typesafe.ai` | Global config only |

`exclude` patterns are
[git glob pathspecs](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitglossary#Documentation/gitglossary.txt-aiddefpathspecapathspec),
relative to the repository root. `*` doesn't match across directories, so use `**/*.pem` to
match at any depth. A project's patterns are added to your global ones.

`types` lists built-in types by name. For your own types, use a table of names to
descriptions. Jev uses the descriptions to tell types apart, and an empty description keeps
the built-in one:

```toml
[types]
feat = ""
fix = ""
deps = "Updates or adds third-party dependencies"
```

Type names must be lowercase letters. A project's `types` replace your global ones.

`scopes` entries from both files are combined, and the project's entry wins when both set
the same path.

`base_url` can't be set in `.jev-cc.toml`, so a repository you clone can't send your diffs
and API key somewhere else.

Run `jev-cc config` to see the settings in effect and where each one comes from.
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY` overrides the key saved by `jev-cc login`.

## Classification

1. **Skip** merges, squashes, amends, `fixup!`/`squash!` commits, and messages that already
   start with `type:` or `type(scope):`.
2. **Local rules.** If every changed file is documentation, a test or CI config, the type is
   `docs`, `test` or `ci`, and no request is made. This only applies when that type is in
   `types`.
3. **Jev.** Otherwise, one request asks two questions about the changed file list, a trimmed
   patch (lockfiles and binaries omitted, about 24 KB at most) and your message:
   - `type`: a choice between your `types`, or by default `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`,
     `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore` and `revert`
   - `breaking`: yes or no
4. **Scope.** With `scopes` configured, each changed file takes the scope of its longest
   matching path, so `packages/web/admin/users.ts` gets `(admin)` in the example above.
   Without `scopes`, it's the directory every changed file shares, skipping container
   directories such as `src/` and `packages/`, so changes only in `src/config/` get
   `(config)`. If the files disagree, there's no scope. Lockfiles are ignored, because they
   change along with whatever they belong to.

## Privacy

When the local rules can't decide, jev-cc sends the following to TypeSafe
(`api.typesafe.ai`, or your `base_url`):

- the paths of your staged files, except those matched by `exclude`
- the patch for those files, trimmed to about 24 KB, with lockfile and binary contents left
  out
- your commit message, if you've written one

The repository name, remote, branch and author are not sent. Diffs that only touch docs,
tests or CI config aren't sent anywhere.

Any secrets in your staged changes are sent along with the patch. Keep sensitive paths out
with `exclude`, catch secrets elsewhere with a secret scanner in a `pre-commit` hook, and
don't install jev-cc in repositories whose code can't leave your machine.

## Development

```sh
cargo test
cargo build --release
./target/release/jev-cc install   # dogfood: classify this repo's own commits
```

To measure a change to classification, run `jev-cc eval` in a repository whose history
already uses conventional prefixes. It replays the last 50 labelled commits (`--limit`)
through the classifier and reports accuracy and the most common mistakes. `--message` also
sends each commit's description, as `git commit -m` would, and `--out FILE` writes every
answer with Jev's probabilities as JSON lines. Set `types` in that repository's
`.jev-cc.toml` to match its conventions first; many projects label dependency and CI
updates `chore`, which the default types would call `build` and `ci`.

### Releasing

Releases are built by [dist](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/) in
`.github/workflows/release.yml`. Bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, then push a matching tag:

```sh
git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0
```

This builds macOS, Linux (glibc and static musl) and Windows binaries, generates the
installers, and publishes a GitHub Release. After changing `dist-workspace.toml`, run
`dist generate` to regenerate the workflow.

## Status

Early development.
